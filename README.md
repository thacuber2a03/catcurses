# catcurses

ncurses, abstracted around [Umka](https://github.com/vtereshkov/umka-lang).

```go
import (
	cc = "catcurses.um"
)

fn main() {
	term := cc::stdTerminal()
	term.raw(true)
	term.echo(false)

	win := term.window
	win.print("hello world!")
	win.refresh()
	win.getChar()

	term.destroy()
}
```

See [the examples folder](./examples) for more.

This library is still in progress. The API can change at any time.
Currently, the only documentation is [autogenerated](./doc/catcurses.md) by [mmdoc](https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/mmdoc).
Sorry in advance.
