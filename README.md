# catcurses

ncurses, abstracted around [Umka](https://github.com/vtereshkov/umka-lang).

```umka
import (
	cc = "catcurses.um"
)

fn main() {
	t := cc::stdTerminal()
	t.raw(true)
	t.echo(false)

	w := t.window
	w.print("hello world!")
	w.refresh()
	w.getChar()

	t.destroy()
}

```

See [the examples folder](./examples) for more.

This library is still in progress. The API can change at any time.
Currently, the only documentation is [autogenerated](./doc/catcurses.md) by a modified version of [mmdoc](https://git.sr.ht/~mrms/mmdoc).
Sorry in advance.
